 * Networking Plugin API
 * =====================
 *
 * Connection
 * ----------
 * Client-server connections are represented by a `UA_Connection`. The
 * connection is stateful and stores partially received messages, and so on. In
 * addition, the connection contains function pointers to the underlying
 * networking implementation. An example for this is the `send` function. So the
 * connection encapsulates all the required networking functionality. This lets
 * users on embedded (or otherwise exotic) systems implement their own
 * networking plugins with a clear interface to the main open62541 library. */
